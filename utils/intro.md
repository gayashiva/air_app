This app showcases the results from a [publication](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2021.771342/full) that evaluated fountain efficiency and meltwater quantities of scientific icestupas in India and Switzerland. Start by selecting a scientific icestupa from the left. The charts below will display the model expectation vs the validation measurements for the ice volumes.

Some Icestupas also have a timelapse video that shows the daily variation in ice volumes seen at the respective site.

More details about the model input and output dataset are available via various visualization options at the top.

üíª The code is available [here](https://github.com/Gayashiva/air_model).
